# SQL For Business Analysis: Answering Key Questions
This SQL and Python project contains comprehensive analysis of an e-store sample database to derive key business metrics crucial for strategic decision-making. The project delved into essential aspects of the e-commerce landscape, including identifying top-selling genres, breaking down sales by country, examining the percentage of customers contributing to overall sales, and determining the average order value. A notable feature of the project was the visualization of both the average order and its deviation from the mean in a single graph, providing a nuanced understanding of purchasing patterns. Additionally, the calculation of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) was a pivotal component, offering insights into the long-term value generated by individual customers. These metrics collectively play a vital role in guiding business strategies, optimizing marketing efforts, and enhancing overall operational efficiency in the dynamic and competitive realm of e-commerce.
